*Update through the curseforge Option or just join a server to auto-update*
*Troubleshooting is down below*

## Re-Added 
  -Simple Clouds https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-clouds

## Added
  -Pretty Rain https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pretty-rain
    -  Pretty Rain replaces the default weather with prettier particle effects.
  -Chunky https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunky-pregenerator-forge
    - Pre-generates chunks, quickly, efficiently, and safely .Mostly Sever Side.
  -Distant Horizons https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/distant-horizons
    - Stores locally loaded chunks and maintains visiblity even when unloaded.

## Troubleshooting
  -Auto-update doesn't update mods on the curseforge app but rather make an folder In your curseforge minecraft folder to run the games off of.
  -If you see Black outlines around tree leaves enabled fancy leaves under the performance setting
  -Distant Horizons doesnt support every shader. If you see ghost blocks or improperly rendered things go to distant horizon > advance options > generic rendering > enable rendering : False
  -You're able to disable distant horizon's through the in-game settings, for performance reasons or shader reasons.
  -You can increase the cloud height for simple clouds on the main menu > Mod > simple clouds > Cloud height. Recommened 250+ Height due to mountains.
  -If you keep having issues when joining a world or server and experience extreme lag disable shaders on the main menu and try again.
  -If Issues with distant horizons persist you can uninstall it as it's client side and wont affect worlds or servers.
  -Seeing outlines on trees when looking at clouds can be fixed by selecting another shader or disabling.
